      Assignment 0 - September 25, 2016 
    </h3>
    <ul>
    The first significant obstacle in this assignment was figuring out how to use github, especially in regards to <br>
    creating new files, committing them, and the branches. The second tough part was the html itself, which was pretty <br>
    easy to look up tags and such. I used 
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags">this website</a> 
    to get most of the tags, and 
      <a href="http://htmlshell.com/">this one</a> 
    for the skeleton. I need to look <br> up how to get a better development environment
    because for this assignment I was just using notepad.
